# TenantCloud

A fully functioning Android App for landlords and tenants.  

Landlords can register their home in the app, post about vacant apartment with photos and suitable description like rent, number of rooms, bathrooms etc.

Tenants can browse through the vacant homes on an area basis, contact with the landlord through the app and can even pay their rent through the app.

Watch the video below to see the demonstration.
